Note on Player Spritesheet and Hand Animations

1. The PlayerBase spritesheet does not include hand sprites.
Instead, the hands are provided in a separate file. 
This approach allows for weapon animations to be integrated seamlessly with the player's hands.
If the hands were included directly in the player spritesheet, the player would appear to have four hands while holding a weapon 
(two from the player spritesheet and two from the weapon animation).

This setup ensures smooth, customizable weapon animations while maintaining visual consistency.


2. The spritesheet is organized row by row based on the player's animation states and directions:

Idle Animations:
Row 1: Idle-Left
Row 2: Idle-Right
Row 3: Idle-Up
Row 4: Idle-Down

Walking Animations:
Row 5: Walk-Left
Row 6: Walk-Right
Row 7: Walk-Up
Row 8: Walk-Down

etc.

Each row contains evenly spaced frames corresponding to the animation for that specific state and direction. 
This structured layout makes it easy to extract frames programmatically for smooth animation implementation.
