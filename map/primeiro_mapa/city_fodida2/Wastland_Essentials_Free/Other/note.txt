A separate shadow sprite is included for character animations. This shadow should be placed beneath the character sprite to create a realistic grounding effect.

You can customize the shadow's appearance by adjusting its alpha (transparency) level to suit the visual style of your game. 
This flexibility allows for better integration with different environments and lighting conditions.
