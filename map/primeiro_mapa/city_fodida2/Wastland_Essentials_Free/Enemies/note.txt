The spritesheet is organized row by row based on the enemy's animation states and directions:

Idle Animations:
Row 1: Idle-Left
Row 2: Idle-Right
Row 3: Idle-Up
Row 4: Idle-Down

Walking Animations:
Row 5: Walk-Left
Row 6: Walk-Right
Row 7: Walk-Up
Row 8: Walk-Down

etc.

Each row contains evenly spaced frames corresponding to the animation for that specific state and direction. 
This structured layout makes it easy to extract frames programmatically for smooth animation implementation.
